Leonard Cohen
_Joan of Arc_      
      
Now the flames they followed Joan of Arc      
As she came riding through the dark      
No moon to keep her Armour bright      
Then no man to get her through this darkest very smoky night      
      
She said, "I'm tired of the war      
I want the kind of work I had before      
With a wedding dress or something white      
To wear upon my swollen appetite"      
      
Well, I'm glad to to hear you talk this way      
You see I've watched you riding all most every single day      
And theres something in me yearns to win      
Such a very cold and such a very lonesome heroine      
      
? Well then, who are you?" she sternly spoke      
To the one beneath the smoke      
"Why, I'm, I'm fire," he replied      
"And I love your solitude, how I love your sense of pride"      
      
"Well then fire, make your body cold      
I'm gonna give you mine to hold"      
Saying this she climbed inside      
To be his one, to be his only bride      
      
It was deep into his fiery heart      
He took the dust of a Joan of Arc      
And high above all these assembled wedding guests      
He hung the ashes of her very lovely wedding dress      
      
It was deep deep into his fiery heart      
That he took the dust of all precious Joan of Arc      
Then she clearly clearly understood      
If if he was fire, oh she must be wood      
      
I saw her wince, I saw her cry      
I saw the glory in her eye      
Myself I long, I long for love and light      
But must it come so cruel, and must it must it be so very bright?
